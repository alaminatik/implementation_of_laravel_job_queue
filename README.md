##  Run Final Artisan command 
```
Laravel includes an Artisan command that will start a queue worker and process new jobs as they are pushed onto the queue. You may run the worker using the below Artisan command.

$php artisan queue:work

Alternatively, you may run the queue:listen command. When using the queue:listen command, you donâ€™t have to manually restart the worker when you want to reload your updated code or reset the application state. 

$php artisan queue:listen


Now you can run project using bellow command:

php artisan serve
